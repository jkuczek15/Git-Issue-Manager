# Git issue tracking and Version control System

This is a side project I am working on over the course of the summer. The idea is to create one centralized tool for software development issue management and version control. The hope is to create a scrum style board that integrates Githubs web api to allow for easy creation of branches from different issues created on the site. The end goal is to be able to merge an issue into a master branch once the issue has been finalized and approved. 

Users will be able to comment on different issues as sort of a code review. Another goal is to alive live code edits. This project aims to use PHP, MySQL, Laravel, JQuery for making the web api calls, and a Javascript framework for creating a single page web application.
